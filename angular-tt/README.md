## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Local server IMPORTANT!

The problem with server installation wasn't solved, solution will be the fake server with imported library `json-server`.

Run `npx json-server db.json` for a database fake server.
